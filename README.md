## Features

The main features of the JustWifi library are:

* Configure multiple possible networks
* Scan wifi networks so it can try to connect to only those available, in order of signal strength
* Smart Config support (when built with -DJUSTWIFI_ENABLE_SMARTCONFIG, tested with ESP8266 SmartConfig or IoT SmartConfig apps)
* WPS support (when built with -DJUSTWIFI_ENABLE_WPS)
* Fallback to AP mode
* Configurable timeout to try to reconnect after AP fallback
* AP+STA mode
* Static IP (autoconnect is disabled when using static IP)
* Single debug/action callback
